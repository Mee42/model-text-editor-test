This is the help page!
Here you can find lots of information about how to use this text editor!

Read on for basic usage:

In this text editor, there are several modes. The default is normal mode.

Normal Mode:
  In Normal mode, you can navigate around the buffer using the arrow keys.
  The keys on the keyboard all have special meanings, and perform a
  specified action immediately on keypress. You can see them all documented
  later in this document. One important one is <i>, which switches the mode
  to Insert Mode

Insert Mode:
  When in Insert mode, you can navigate around the buffer with the
  arrow keys, and insert text by typing characters on the keyboard.
  This is like a traditional text editor.
  Press escape to go back to Normal mode.

Command Mode:
  You can reach Command mode by typing <:> in Normal mode. Command mode
  allows you to run one or more 'commands', which are documented below.
  Commands are shown and denoted by the preluding ':'.
  Common ones include `:h` for help, ':w' for write, ':q' for quit, etc

            hidden stack
[NORMAL]  | The current mode
1/11      | The current line, 1/The number of lines in the file, 11
7         | The current column, 7

Everything after those is the *message*, which is set specially for various
reasons.


Command Documentation:


Here's some commands you can use:

    :write :w  writes the buffer to the page

Some commands take in arguments.
